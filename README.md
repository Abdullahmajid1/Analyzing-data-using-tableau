# Sales Data Visualization

This repository contains visualizations of sales data obtained from a Kaggle dataset. The data is analyzed to identify key insights regarding sales performance, specifically focusing on product sales. The visualization highlights the following points:

2. **Dashboard and Story Creation**: A dashboard and story are created to provide a comprehensive overview of the sales data, allowing for easier interpretation and analysis.
