# Sales Data Visualization

This repository contains visualizations of sales data obtained from a Kaggle dataset. The data is analyzed to identify key insights regarding sales performance, specifically focusing on product sales. The visualization highlights the following points:

1. **Highest and Lowest Sale Amounts**: Identifies which product had the highest and lowest sale amounts in terms of dollar value.

2. **Top 3 Products with Highest Sales**: Visualizes the top 3 products with the highest sales, along with their subcategory and product name.

## Methodology

The data is visualized using a bar graph where categories are plotted against sales values. The visualization is enhanced in two ways:

1. **Sorting Sales by Descending Order**: The sales values are sorted in descending order to emphasize the top-performing categories.

2. **Dashboard and Story Creation**: A dashboard and story are created to provide a comprehensive overview of the sales data, allowing for easier interpretation and analysis.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Kaggle and contains detailed information about sales data, including product names, categories, and sales amounts.
